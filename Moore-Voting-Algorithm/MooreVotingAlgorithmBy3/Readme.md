## What is majorityElement Algorithm?

The Boyer-Moore``majorityElement 2`` method is a popular optimal technique for determining the majority element among provided array items with more than N/ 2 occurrences.
## How does it work?

``majorityElement`` in an array ``mooreArray`` of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).
